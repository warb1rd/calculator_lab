The goal of this lab is to buid a calculator that adds, subtracts, multiplies, and divides - without using the existing eval() function.

### Jumping off Point
- Fork and clone the WDI_56 repo
- Navigate to the work/02_week/calculator_lab directory
- Work with the files structure provided 
- Note, the below is not an exhaustive list 

**HTML** - You'll need to account for the following:
- A readout (where you'll see the input and result)
- Buttons for numbers 0 - 9 and .
- Buttons for `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`
- Button for 'equals' or 'calculate'

**CSS**

**JavaScript** - You'll need to:
- Access DOM elements
- Use event listeners
- Change the innerHTML of an element
- 

**Consider**:
- DOM manipulation
- `this` keyword
- for loops (or forEach)
- if/else statements


**Bonus**:
- Try to create a 'clear' button
- Try to make your calculator able to chain multiple operations (5 + 10 * 9 / 3)
- Try using a switch statement instead of if/else
